# 💻 Glassmorphism Login Form

## Project Overview
This is a simple login form web application designed with **glassmorphism** aesthetics. The app allows users to input their **username** and **password** and validates whether both fields are filled. If valid, the app displays a welcome message and resets the form. If invalid, an error message is shown.

## 💻 Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in the development of this application:
- **HTML5**: Used for the structure of the login form and basic layout.
- **CSS3**: Styled the page with a frosted background effect, utilizing glassmorphism for a sleek, modern appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Used for the form validation logic, ensuring the user enters both username and password before submitting.

## 💡 Concepts Learned
While working on this project, I explored the following concepts:

### 1. **HTML5 (Structure and Semantics)**
   - **Forms and Inputs**: Using `<input>` elements for user data entry, such as username and password fields.
   - **Semantic HTML**: Structuring content logically using basic HTML elements.

### 2. **CSS3 (Styling and Layout)**
   - **Glassmorphism**: Implementing a frosted background effect using `backdrop-filter` for a sleek, modern UI design.
   - **Flexbox**: Leveraging Flexbox to center elements on the page and create a responsive layout.
   - **Input and Button Styling**: Creating visually appealing input fields and buttons to enhance user interaction.

### 3. **JavaScript (Logic and Interactivity)**
   - **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically validating the login form and displaying messages based on user input.
   - **Event Handling**: Using event listeners to handle the form submission and validation.

## 🔍 Features and How They Work

### 1. 🧑‍💻 User Login Form
Users can enter their **username** and **password** in the respective fields. If both fields are filled, the app displays a welcome message, and the form is reset.

### 2. ⚠️ Form Validation
The app validates that both the username and password fields are filled before submission. If either field is empty, an error message will appear, prompting the user to complete both fields.

### 3. 📐 Simple Design
The page utilizes a **glassmorphism** design with a frosted background effect, providing a modern and visually appealing aesthetic. The form is centered on the page, and the inputs and button are styled to complement the overall design.

## 🚀 Installation
To run the Glassmorphism Login Form locally:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FranklynPedro/GlassmorphismLoginForm.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd GlassmorphismLoginForm
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the application.

No server setup is required, as this is a client-side application.

## 📐 Usage

### Submitting the Form
1. Enter a **username** and **password** in the respective fields and click "Submit."
2. If both fields are filled, a welcome message will appear, and the form will reset.
3. If either field is empty, an error message will appear asking the user to enter both fields.
